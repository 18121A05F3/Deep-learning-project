In space, a variety of weak radio waves are released.We can divide them into four groups to help with comprehension.We handle the signals as 2D spectrograms, which are pictures.The Allen Telescope Array at the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) Institute gathered the 2D spectrograms of deep space radio waves that make up the data. To categorize the signals into one of four groups, an image classification model was trained using the spectrograms as images.
